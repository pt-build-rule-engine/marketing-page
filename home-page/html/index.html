            <h2>Why Rule-Engine?</h2>
            <p>Many companies, when a minor decision needs to be made, there are often many people involved. When the
                decision is as minor as getting a new office chair, holding a meeting with your manager, her boss, those
                finance guys, and that girl that places all the orders can be a waste of time for something that seems
                so easy. The alternative is write up a form, email it to everybody, make sure it gets approved in the
                right order, and hope it
                doesn't get lost somewhere along the way. This can sometimes take weeks! Luckily for you, there is
                Rule-Engine!
                This is an app that streamlines and organises this process, and
                makes sure the right people
                get the right information so that the right decision can be made as quickly as possible!</p>

            <h2>Why do we do it?</h2>
            <p>Simply put, we get it! Having to struggle with a half-broken office chair for weeks and feeling it slowly
                ruin your back just
                bacause Barbra from HR has your request for a new one sitting in her mail box while she's off doing
                "important company work".
                You know its going to be at least another two weeks before the problem is fixed. We get it, and we don't
                like it either so we
                created Rule-Engine to stop that headache and let you do more of what you love!

            <h2>Track your forms!</h2>
            <p>Ever wonder why your request for a new keyboard is taking so long, only to find out someone set it aside
                and forgot about it?
                No longer will you have to track down exactly who lost it! Now track your request through every hoop,
                all from your desk!
